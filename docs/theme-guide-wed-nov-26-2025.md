# Theme Guide — Wed Nov 26 2025

This guide explains each configurable property available in the Theme Creator so designers can build consistent experiences across web, iOS, and Android.

## Theme Info
- **Theme Name**: The display label for your theme. If left blank, a localized random name is generated.
- **Logo**: Choose from provided logo assets and set a **Fill Color** that tints SVG artwork.

## Colors
- **Background Colors**: Control the app background (`background`), cards and containers (`surface`), and modal overlays (`overlay`).
- **Text Colors**: Define primary, secondary, and muted text colors. Preview blocks show headings, body text, and placeholder-style text.
- **Interactive Colors**: Set the main accent for buttons/highlights, the text color on accent surfaces, and the border color used for outlines/dividers.
- **Status Colors**: Provide dedicated success, danger, and info colors for badges, alerts, and confirmations.

## Typography
- **Font Families**: Assign fonts for display, regular, light, medium, semi-bold, and bold weights.
- **Sizes**: Adjust text sizes for headings, body, captions, and other roles using the sliders.

## Components
- **Cards**: Configure padding, radius, gaps, and margins for card layouts.
- **Buttons**: Tune padding and corner radii for primary, secondary, and pill buttons.
- **Lists**: Control list padding, spacing, border radii, and gap between list items.
- **Headers & Inputs**: Set padding, gaps, and font sizing for page headers and form inputs.
- **Rails**: Adjust gaps and margins for rail-based layouts.

## Navigation Bar
- **Show Icons / Labels**: Toggle icon and label visibility for navigation items, including uppercase label styling.
- **Tab Icons**: Pick individual icons for Home, Kitchen, and Lists tabs.
- **Button Shape**: Switch between pill and box shapes for navigation triggers.
- **Icon Size**: Use the dedicated slider to change the size of navigation icons.
- **Border Radii**: Separate sliders for list container radius and trigger (button) radius.

## Logo Fill & SVG Support
All SVG logos respect the chosen fill color. Use the color picker with “Select Color” to match your palette and ensure logos remain visible on light or dark backgrounds.

## Saving & Sharing Themes
- Saving generates a share code that is shown after the modal closes and inside the custom theme card. Use the **Copy** action to share with teammates.
- Share codes can be applied later from the Theme Switcher to load your saved design.
